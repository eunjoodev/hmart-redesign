# H Mart Web Redesign (Personal Project)

This is a personal redesign and front-end publishing project based on H Mart’s web UI.  
It was created to improve layout structure, visual consistency, and user flow.

## ✨ Purpose

- Improve visual layout and UX flow of H Mart's web page.
- Practice HTML/CSS publishing with a focus on structure and layout.
- Understand real-world e-commerce UI structure.

## 🛠️ Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 / jQuery  
- jQuery animation plugins (easing, GSAP)  
- Static asset-based layout (image-driven)

## 📌 Highlights

- Entire layout designed from image mockups to reflect real UI behavior.
- Publishing built with static assets and hover/interactions using only HTML/CSS/JS.

## 🚀 Preview (optional)

You can view it live via local development using **https://eunjoodev.github.io/hmart-redesign/index.html**.

## 💡 Notes

- This is a legacy code project built during the early stages of HTML/CSS learning.
- Project is not fully responsive yet, but layout intent and structure are clearly defined.
- Image assets used as placeholders for UI behavior simulation.
